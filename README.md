**Article:** Zijian Zhao, Weichao Zeng, Fupeng He, Yutong He, Yiyi Wang, Xiao Liang, Chengying Gao*: PianoBART: Symbolic Piano Music Understanding and Generating with Large-Scale Pre-Training (in progress)

Some parts of our code borrows from [muzic/musicbert at main · microsoft/muzic (github.com) [1]](https://github.com/microsoft/muzic/tree/main/musicbert) and [wazenmai/MIDI-BERT: This is the official repository for the paper, MidiBERT-Piano: Large-scale Pre-training for Symbolic Music Understanding. (github.com) [2]](https://github.com/wazenmai/MIDI-BERT).



## 1. Dataset

The datasets utilized in our paper are as follows:

**Pretrain:** POP1K7, ASAP, POP909, Pianist8, EMOPIA

**Generation:** Maestro, GiantMidi

**Composer Classification:** ASAP, Pianist8

**Emotion Classification:** EMOPIA

**Velocity Prediction:** GiantMidi

**Melody Prediction:** POP909



You can generate data using the repositories mentioned in [[1]](https://github.com/microsoft/muzic/tree/main/musicbert) and [[2]](https://github.com/wazenmai/MIDI-BERT). The process of organizing the data is the same as described in [[2]](https://github.com/wazenmai/MIDI-BERT). Additionally, you can use the `--datasets` and `--dataroot` options to specify the name and root path of your dataset.



## 2. How to run the model

### 2.1 About the environment

We provide a conda-based environment. To use this environment, please install it using the following command:

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This environment has been tested and is working properly.

To run the model, please refer to the code at the bottom of "main.py", which is shown as follows.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    pretrain()
    #finetune()
    #finetune_generation()
    #abalation()
```

You can uncomment the corresponding function to perform the desired task.



### 2.2 Pretrain

Uncomment the “pretrain()” in main.py and run it.

```shell
python main.py
```



### 2.3 Finetune


#### 2.3.1 Generation

> Note: Before run the code, please do the following steps to patch the code.

1. Locate the file of `shapesimilarity.py`, which probably is in the path of `your_env/lib/python{version}/site-packages/shapesimilarity/shapesimilarity.py`.

2. Use the patch we provide, simply just run the following command in the terminal.

```shell
patch <path of shapesimilarity.py> < patches/shapesimilarity.patch
```

For example, if you use the conda-based environment we provide, you can run the following command.

> Assume the conda environment is located in `~/anaconda3/envs/Bart`.

```shell
patch ~/anaconda3/envs/Bart/lib/python3.8/site-packages/shapesimilarity/shapesimilarity.py < patches/shapesimilarity.patch
```

Uncomment the `finetune_generation()` in main.py and run it.

```shell
python main.py
```

Some parameters you may need to change:
 * `--ckpt`: The path of the model you want to load.
 * `--datasets`: The name of the dataset you want to use.
 * `--dataroot`: The root path of the dataset you want to use.
 * `--cuda_devices`: The GPU you want to use.
 * `--class_num`: The class amount of the task.

for example, if you want to use the GiantMIDI1k dataset which we used, you can run it with

```shell
python main.py --datasets GiantMIDI1k --dataroot Data/output_generate/GiantMIDI1k/gen_method --ckpt <model path> --cuda_devices <GPU ids>
```



In the following tasks, you can uncomment the `finetune()` in main.py and run it.

#### 2.3.2 Composer Classification

```shell
python main.py --datasets <dataset name> --dataroot <root path of dataset> --class_num <class number> --task composer
```



#### 2.3.3 Emotion Classification

```shell
python main.py --datasets <dataset name> --dataroot <root path of dataset> --class_num <class number> --task emotion
```



#### 2.3.4 Velocity Prediction

```shell
python main.py --datasets <dataset name> --dataroot <root path of dataset> --class_num <class number> --task velocity
```



#### 2.3.5 Melody Prediction

```shell
python main.py --datasets <dataset name> --dataroot <root path of dataset> --class_num <class number> --task melody
```





## 3. Demo

In this section, you can input an intro (MIDI file) to PianoBart, and it will generate a new MIDI file inspired by the input. Simply provide the intro as input, and PianoBart will use its trained models to generate a new MIDI file with a similar style and tone.

```shell
python --ckpt <model path> --input <input path> --output <output path> demo.py
```

Please note that there is a bug in demo.py that restricts the usage to only one CUDA device or CPU.



You can also use eval_generation.py to generate music in one go, with the output format as numpy.array. However, you must set the batch size as 1 and use only one GPU or CPU.

```shell
python --ckpt <model path> --dataset_path <dataset_path> --dataset_name <dataset_name> --output <output path> eval_generation.py
```
